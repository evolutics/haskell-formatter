# Lines should be no longer than this length in characters.
line_length_limit: 80

# How much to spread code over multiple lines instead of trying to fill a single
# line. More precisely, this guides the ratio of "line_length_limit" to the
# ribbon length (the number of characters on a line without leading and trailing
# whitespace). Only the lowest value of 1 forces "line_length_limit" to be
# applied strictly.
